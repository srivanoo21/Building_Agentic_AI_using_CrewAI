## Define AI Agents and its parameters:
# role             - Defines the agentâ€™s role (e.g., Research Analyst, Content Writer)
# goal             - Specifies the main objective of the agent
# backstory        - Provides context for the agentâ€™s skills, expertise, and behavior
# allow_delegation - If True, the agent can delegate tasks to others. If False, it must complete tasks itself
# tools	           - List of tools the agent can use (e.g., web search tools)
# llm              - Defines the language model (e.g., GPT-4) used by the agent
# verbose          - If True, it enables detailed logging for debugging
